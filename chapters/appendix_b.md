# Appendix B: Frameworks Summary



This appendix summarizes the core frameworks referenced throughout the book. Use it as a quick reference or as a handout in executive sessions.



## B1. The Refinery Problem

**Insight:** Data is not valuable until it is refined into usable products.

**Signal:** High AI investment with low operational impact.

**Fix:** Build governance, quality, and product discipline before scaling models.



## B2. Structural Misalignment Model

**Problem:** Data teams buried under IT/finance become service desks.

**Outcome:** Low retention, fragmented ownership, stalled AI value.

**Fix:** Standalone data department with clear charter and decision rights.



## B3. Governance Spine

**Purpose:** Define decision rights that do not change across tools or vendors.

**Core questions:** Access, quality thresholds, model approvals, incident response.

**Outcome:** Trust and speed at scale.



## B4. Hub‑and‑Spoke Org Design

**Hub:** Platform, standards, governance, shared products.

**Spokes:** Embedded delivery teams aligned to business outcomes.

**Benefit:** Central consistency with local execution.



## B5. Data Quality Dimensions (ISO)

**Seven dimensions:** Accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, relevance, uniqueness.

**Usage:** Each model should list which dimensions matter most and how they are measured.



## B6. FAIR Principles

**Findable:** Data can be located without tribal knowledge.

**Accessible:** Authorized users can retrieve data quickly.

**Interoperable:** Data can be joined across systems.

**Reusable:** Data supports multiple use cases without rebuilding.



## B7. Risk Tiers for AI

**Low:** Internal automation, minimal external impact.

**Medium:** Customer‑facing decisions with limited consequence.

**High:** Healthcare, finance, employment, legal decisions.

**Implication:** Higher tiers require stricter governance and auditability.



## B8. Build‑Buy‑Partner Matrix

**Build:** Core capability + long‑term control required.

**Buy:** Non‑core + speed required.

**Partner:** Need speed and internal learning.



## B9. Sovereignty Spectrum

**Public Cloud:** Lowest control, fastest experimentation.

**Sovereign Cloud:** Compliance‑friendly, moderate control.

**Private Cloud / On‑Prem:** Highest control, highest strategic value.



## B10. Data Flywheel

**Cycle:** Proprietary data → private model → better outcomes → more data.

**Risk:** Poor data quality amplifies errors.

**Reward:** Compounding advantage over time.
