# Chapter 2: What's Holding Businesses Back?

Let's be honest—most businesses know they need to transform their data operations. They see competitors pulling ahead, read about AI breakthroughs, and feel the pressure to act. So why aren't they? Adoption has surged, but returns still lag for most organizations. The gap between knowing and doing isn't just wide—it's growing.

Three critical barriers keep emerging.

## The Education Gap
First, there's the education gap. It's not just about technical knowledge—it's about business literacy. When leaders don't understand how data drives value, they either underinvest or chase the wrong outcomes. The best teams don't just approve AI projects; they understand how data creates business advantage.

## The Structural Misalignment
Second, structural misalignment cripples potential. Look at most enterprises today: data teams scattered across departments, reporting through IT or finance, fighting for resources and attention. It's like trying to run a restaurant with the kitchen staff split between different buildings. Structure matters.

## The Ownership Vacuum
Third, and most critically, there's no clear owner for data strategy. Without a Chief Data Officer or equivalent leader with real authority, data initiatives become a game of hot potato. Everyone wants the benefits; nobody wants the responsibility. This isn't just inefficient—it's dangerous. Just ask United Healthcare about their AI claims system debacle. When nobody owns the strategy, everybody owns the failure.

These aren't theoretical problems—they're costing real money. But here's what's interesting: these barriers aren't technological. You can buy the best AI platforms, hire top data scientists, and still fail if your foundation isn't right. Consider BP's transformation: before they built their comprehensive data governance framework, they were drowning in inconsistencies. After restructuring their data operations, the technology didn’t change—the approach did.

Let's talk about talent, because this is where many companies stumble hardest. The typical pattern goes like this: hire expensive data scientists, bury them in IT or finance, watch them leave within 18 months. [SRC-01] Rinse, repeat. When Vimeo faced this challenge, they completely restructured their analytics team. Instead of organizing by stakeholder verticals (product, marketing, etc.), they created functional pods focused on core analytics, business insights, and data science. Result? Better collaboration, clearer career paths, and higher retention.
The cost of these misalignments isn't just financial—it's existential. While companies debate where to place their data teams, the market moves on. Companies that improve analytics coherence across departments tend to outperform peers not because they have better tools, but because they use their data more effectively.
Education gaps among decision-makers create a particularly vicious cycle. When leaders don't understand data operations, they tend to either underinvest or throw money at vendors without a clear strategy. CSE Insurance broke this cycle by establishing a group of data champions and implementing a comprehensive documentation platform. They didn't just train their technical teams—they focused on building data literacy across the organization.
The irony is that the solutions are known. When companies invest in data literacy and clear ownership, adoption rises and decision quality improves. These companies aren't succeeding because they have secret technology—they're winning because they've addressed the fundamental barriers head-on.
But perhaps the most insidious barrier is the "cost center" mindset. As long as data operations are viewed primarily as an expense, they'll be treated like one. This ignores the reality that well-structured data departments can generate significant revenue. Look at Mastercard Advisors, which turned their transaction data into a thriving consulting business, or Progressive Insurance's Snapshot program, which transformed driving data into a new revenue stream.
The problem compounds when we look at how most businesses approach AI adoption. They try to bolt AI onto existing structures without fixing their data foundation first. It's like trying to build a racecar on a bicycle frame—the engine might be powerful, but the structure can't support it.

This is why barrier work has to happen before big model bets. Otherwise, every pilot becomes a cautionary tale.
Let's break down what this looks like in practice. A typical enterprise has data scattered across dozens of systems, managed by different teams, with no single source of truth. They might have talented people, but they're fighting against their own infrastructure. GE Aviation faced this exact challenge. Their solution? They created a Self-Service Data team responsible for user enablement, tooling, and data product deployment. More importantly, they separated database administration from data governance, creating clear lines of responsibility.
The regulatory landscape makes these structural problems even more pressing. When BP implemented their governance framework, they didn't just focus on compliance—they built a three-layer approach:
- Strategy: Clear ownership and measurable standards
- Implementation: Automated monitoring and regular audits
- Risk Management: Proactive detection and incident response

The results? Not just better compliance, but faster project delivery and significantly higher data quality scores.

That brings us to the final barrier: measurement.
Most businesses still evaluate their data operations using IT metrics—uptime, response time, ticket resolution. But these metrics miss the point entirely. When data products drive growth, it isn’t because uptime improved—it’s because the organization reimagined how data could create value.
The path forward requires rethinking not just where data teams sit in the organization, but how they operate. Companies succeeding in this transition aren't just moving boxes on an org chart—they're fundamentally reimagining how data drives their business. The question isn't whether to make this change; it's how fast you can afford to move.
The size of your organization shouldn't dictate your approach—it should inform it. Based on the data we've seen across industries, successful transformations follow different paths depending on company scale. A framework emerges:

For businesses under $50 million in revenue, the focus should be on building core capabilities with a lean team of 3-5 generalists. Your key hire here is a Lead Data Engineer who can build the foundation while understanding the business context. It's tempting to chase advanced AI applications, but the reality is that solid data engineering and basic analytics will deliver more immediate value.
Mid-sized companies ($50M-$500M) need a more structured approach. With teams of 10-20 specialists organized into pods, they can tackle more complex challenges like machine learning implementation and advanced analytics. The critical hire shifts to a Head of Data Science who can bridge technical capabilities with business outcomes. This is where we see companies like CSE Insurance succeeding with their data champions model.
Large enterprises ($500M+) require a hub-and-spoke model with 25+ core team members and embedded specialists across business units. At this scale, you need a Chief Data Officer with both technical depth and business acumen. Companies like Walmart and Progressive succeed here because they've built data operations that can both innovate and scale.
But size isn't everything. The speed of transformation matters more than the size of your team. Look at Vimeo's restructuring: they didn't just grow their data team—they reorganized it for better collaboration and clearer outcomes. Their functional pod structure delivers more value than larger, less organized teams.
The key metrics shift with scale too. Small teams should focus on time to insight and model deployment frequency. Mid-sized operations need to track data quality scores and direct revenue impact. Enterprise teams must measure both immediate returns and long-term value creation through new data products and services.
What's striking is how consistent the barriers remain across company sizes. Whether you're running a $10 million business or a $10 billion enterprise, the fundamental challenges of education gaps, structural misalignment, and unclear ownership persist. The difference lies in how you address them.
So where do we go from here? The path forward isn't about throwing out everything and starting over—it's about systematic transformation. Consider how Progressive Insurance approached this challenge. Instead of trying to rebuild their entire data infrastructure overnight, they started with a single initiative: the Snapshot program. It wasn't just about collecting driving data; it was about proving that data could create new revenue streams while improving core business operations.

These results only come when you address all three critical barriers simultaneously:
1. Education gaps at the leadership level
2. Structural misalignment of data operations
3. Lack of clear ownership and strategy

MGM Resorts International offers a perfect case study here. When they implemented their data-driven decision-making platform in 2019, they didn't just focus on the technology. They restructured their data operations, invested in leadership development, and created clear lines of accountability.
The transition requires patience, but not hesitation. Companies that improve analytics coherence across departments don’t wait for perfect conditions—they move decisively while accepting that transformation takes time.
As we move into Part 2 of this book, we'll explore exactly how to build that foundation. We'll look at the specific steps needed to create modern data operations, from team structure to governance frameworks. But first, let's be clear about one thing: the barriers we've discussed aren't roadblocks—they're signposts. They show us exactly where we need to focus our efforts to succeed.
The cost of inaction is simply too high. While some companies debate whether to transform their data operations, others are already reaping the benefits. The gap between leaders and laggards isn't shrinking—it's growing exponentially. The question isn't whether to change; it's how quickly you can get started.

## The Compounding Effect
These barriers don't add—they multiply. When leaders lack data literacy, they fund the wrong priorities. When structures are misaligned, resources get trapped in bureaucracy. When no one owns strategy, accountability evaporates. The result is a widening performance gap: organizations with unified data leadership pull farther ahead while fragmented organizations fall behind year after year.

As we move into Part 2, we'll focus on how to remove these barriers systematically. The tools exist. The talent is available. What’s missing is the organizational courage to build the foundation that lets data do its job. In Chapter 3, we move from diagnosis to design—what a modern operating model looks like when you’re ready to execute.
