# Codex Working Notes

## Project Overview
- Book project focused on enterprise data operations, AI readiness, and organizational design.
- Primary outline: `updated_book_outline_v2.md`.
- Draft chapters: `chapters/chapter1.md`, `chapters/chapter2.md`, `chapters/chapter3.md`.
- Source compendium: `2025_data_sources.md`.
- Style guidance: `writing_style_directions.md`.

## Directory Map
- `updated_book_outline_v2.md`: master outline and data points to weave into chapters.
- `chapters/`: chapter drafts in progress.
- `2025_data_sources.md`: research notes and statistics to cite or verify.
- `writing_style_directions.md`: tone, reading level, and voice references.

## Writing Style
- Conversational, straightforward, 12th-grade reading level.
- Actionable and practical with real-world examples and case studies.
- Balanced for technical and non-technical readers; avoid heavy jargon.
- Voice homage to Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Baldwin, and Ibram X. Kendi.

## Source Handling
- Treat `2025_data_sources.md` as a starting point, not final citations.
- Verify every statistic and claim before publication.
- Add citations adjacent to claims; keep a short "Sources" list per chapter draft.

## Drafting Conventions
- Short paragraphs for readability.
- Clear section headers and consistent formatting across chapters.
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract claims.
- Preserve the core thesis: organizational design drives AI outcomes more than technology.

## Next Editing Pass (Suggested)
- Align chapter structure to the outline sections in `updated_book_outline_v2.md`.
- Normalize repeated stats and ensure each appears with a verifiable source.
- Tighten language where there is redundancy across chapters.
