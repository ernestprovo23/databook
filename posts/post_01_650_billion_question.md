There is a number that should haunt every executive who has approved an AI initiative in the last five years.

$650 billion.

That is the estimated amount enterprises worldwide have spent on artificial intelligence projects since 2020. And according to McKinsey, Gartner, and IBM's own research, somewhere between 85% and 95% of those projects never make it to production.

Let that land for a moment.

The most overfunded technology initiative in business history is failing at a rate that would get a hospital shut down.

The question is: why?

## The Answer Nobody Wants to Hear

When AI projects fail, organizations do what organizations always do. They look for a technical explanation. The model wasn't accurate enough. The data pipeline wasn't fast enough. The vendor oversold the capability.

These explanations are comfortable because they point outward — at the tool, at the vendor, at the technology itself.

They are almost always wrong.

In the hundreds of data and AI engagements I've been part of, the failure pattern is consistent. It is not a technology gap. It is an org-chart problem masquerading as a technology gap.

The companies that succeed at AI are not the ones that bought the best models. They are the ones that built the organizational infrastructure — the teams, the processes, the data foundations — that allow AI to function at all.

This publication exists to show you how to build that infrastructure.

## What "AI-Ready" Actually Means

Ask ten executives what "AI-ready" means and you'll get ten different answers. Most of them involve GPU clusters, vector databases, or whatever phrase appeared in last quarter's Gartner report.

Here's a more useful definition: **An AI-ready organization is one where data flows reliably from source to decision, with humans who understand it at every step.**

That's it.

Not the fanciest stack. Not the most compute. Not the biggest model.

Reliable data flow. Human understanding at every step.

When I audit an organization that's struggling with AI, I'm not looking at their model performance first. I'm asking:

- Who owns the data that feeds this model?
- How long does it take to know when that data is wrong?
- Can the team explain what the model is doing to a non-technical stakeholder?
- Does the organizational structure reward data quality or just data volume?

The answers to these questions predict AI success more accurately than any benchmark score.

## The Oil Analogy — and Where It Fails

You've heard the phrase: data is the new oil.

It's a useful starting point. Like oil, raw data has limited value until it's refined. Like oil, the infrastructure to extract and process it determines who benefits. Like oil, the organizations that build that infrastructure early tend to dominate their industries.

But the analogy has a dangerous flaw.

Oil, once refined, doesn't change. A barrel of jet fuel refined in 2020 behaves the same as one refined in 2025. Data is not like that. Data decays. Data drifts. Data reflects the organizational decisions, biases, and blind spots of the people who collected it — and those shift constantly.

This means that unlike oil infrastructure, data infrastructure requires **ongoing human judgment** to remain valuable. You can't build a pipeline and walk away. You need people who understand what the data means, can detect when it's degrading, and can communicate its limitations to the people making decisions from it.

That is a team problem. A process problem. An organizational design problem.

It is not a technology problem.

## What This Series Will Cover

Over the next 30 days, I'll publish 12 pieces drawn from *Data Is The New Oil*, my forthcoming book on enterprise AI readiness. In sequence:

1. **The structural barriers** holding most organizations back from AI success
2. **The modern data team** — what it looks like, how to hire for it, how to charter it
3. **The Data Quality Mandate** — the frameworks that separate AI-ready organizations from the rest
4. **Navigating regulatory complexity** without paralysis
5. **Build, buy, or partner** — a decision framework that actually works in practice
6. **Private AI and data sovereignty** — the emerging infrastructure question nobody is asking
7. **Sector case studies** in healthcare, finance, and retail
8. **The 90-Day Action Plan** — concrete, sequenced steps for any organization to begin

Each post is designed to stand alone. Share any of them with an executive who needs to understand why the AI investment isn't working yet.

## One Question Before You Read On

I want to know what you're dealing with.

Reply to this email with one sentence: **What is the hardest data or AI problem your organization is facing right now?**

I read every response. The most common themes will shape future posts.

## YouTube Short Script (60-90 seconds)

**Hook (0-5s)**: "Companies have spent $650 billion on AI. 95% of those projects failed. Here's the one reason no one talks about."

**Body (5-60s)**:
- "It's not the model. It's not the vendor. It's the org chart."
- "AI-ready organizations aren't the ones with the best tech stack. They're the ones where data flows reliably from source to decision — with humans who understand it at every step."
- "I've been in this industry for 10 years. The failure pattern is always the same: we treat AI as a technology purchase, not an organizational transformation."

**CTA (60-90s)**: "I'm serializing my book on this — *Data Is The New Oil* — over the next 30 days on Substack. Free. Link in description."
