I am not interested in leaving you with inspiration. I want to leave you with a Monday morning.

Over the past eleven posts, I have made a sustained argument: organizational design determines AI outcomes. Not technology. Not budget. Not the vendor you choose. The way you structure your data team, the authority you give it, the quality standards you enforce, the sovereignty decisions you make -- these are what separate the organizations that turn data into compounding advantage from the organizations that spend millions and get dashboards nobody trusts.

But frameworks without execution are just theory. And theory does not ship.

So this is the action plan. Ninety days. Three phases. Each phase builds on the one before it. At the end, you will not have an AI product in production -- that is not the goal. The goal is something harder and more valuable: an organization that is genuinely ready to build AI products that work.

## Phase 1: Diagnose (Days 1-30)

You cannot fix what you have not named. The first thirty days are about seeing your organization clearly -- not how you wish it worked, not how the org chart says it works, but how it actually works.

**Week 1: Data Ownership Audit.** Walk the org chart. Every person with "data" in their title -- where do they sit? Who do they report to? What systems do they own? Map this on a single page. You will almost certainly discover that data ownership is fragmented across business units with no shared authority. That is not a failure. That is the diagnosis.

**Week 2: Maturity Assessment.** Use a simple framework -- I provide one in Chapter 3 of the book -- to rate your organization across five dimensions: data quality, governance, infrastructure, talent, and leadership alignment. Rate each from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (optimized). Be honest. Most organizations land between 1.5 and 2.5. That is normal. The purpose is not to feel good about the number. The purpose is to know where you are starting.

**Week 3: Regulatory Constraint Mapping.** List every regulation that applies to your data. For each one, write down what it actually requires (not what your organization interprets it to require -- what the text says). Identify the gaps between the regulation and your organization's response. Flag every instance where your interpretation is broader than the requirement. These are velocity opportunities.

**Week 4: Shadow AI and Sovereignty Audit.** Survey every team: what AI tools are in use? What data flows into them? Who approved it? Map the results. You will find data sovereignty gaps you did not know existed.

| Week | Phase | Action | Owner | Success Indicator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Diagnose | Data ownership audit -- map every data person, reporting line, and system they own | CDO / VP Data | Single-page ownership map completed and reviewed with leadership |
| 2 | Diagnose | Maturity assessment across 5 dimensions (quality, governance, infra, talent, leadership) | CDO + Data Leads | Scored maturity model with gap analysis for each dimension |
| 3 | Diagnose | Regulatory constraint mapping -- actual requirements vs. organizational interpretation | Data Governance + Legal | Constraint map showing regulation text, current interpretation, and identified velocity opportunities |
| 4 | Diagnose | Shadow AI and data sovereignty audit across all teams | Data Governance + Security | Complete inventory of AI tool usage, data flows, and unauthorized sovereignty transfers |
| 5 | Design | Draft or rewrite data department charter (functions, authority, SLAs, metrics) | CDO / VP Data | Charter document reviewed by CEO/COO with explicit authority grants |
| 6 | Design | Define data quality standards -- dimensions, thresholds, measurement methods, owners | Head of Data Governance | Published quality standards with named owners for each critical data domain |
| 7 | Design | Evaluate build/buy/partner for top 3 capability gaps identified in Phase 1 | CDO + Head of Engineering | Decision matrix completed for each capability with recommended path and rationale |
| 8 | Design | Select partnerships and vendors -- initiate procurement for buy decisions | CDO + Procurement | Contracts initiated or LOIs signed for critical buy/partner decisions |
| 9 | Build | Establish or harden core data pipelines for priority use case | Head of Data Engineering | Priority data pipeline running in production with quality checks and monitoring |
| 10 | Build | Launch team training -- upskill on selected tools, frameworks, and governance processes | CDO + Data Leads | Training completed for all data team members, with assessment scores |
| 11 | Build | Run first AI pilot on production-quality data with proper infrastructure and governance | Head of Data Science | AI pilot deployed in staging with documented model decisions, explainability, and monitoring |
| 12 | Build | Retrospective and roadmap -- assess results, document lessons, plan next 90 days | CDO + Full Data Team | Retrospective document with measured outcomes, lessons learned, and prioritized next-phase roadmap |

## Phase 2: Design (Days 31-60)

Diagnosis without design is just complaining. The second thirty days are about making the structural decisions that Phase 1 revealed.

**Week 5: Charter the Data Department.** Using the template from Post 7, draft or rewrite your data team's charter. Define the five functions (engineering, governance, analytics, data science, strategy). Assign owners. Set reporting lines. Write the SLAs. Present this to your CEO or COO -- not as a request, but as a proposal for how the data organization will operate and be held accountable.

This is the hardest step. It requires you to claim authority. Most data leaders have been conditioned to be service providers -- to wait for the business to ask and then deliver. A charter says: we own these functions, we set these standards, and we are accountable for these outcomes. That is a different posture. It is the right one.

**Week 6: Define Data Quality Standards.** Pick the ten most critical data domains in your organization (customer, product, transaction, whatever they are). For each one, define the quality dimensions that matter (accuracy, completeness, timeliness, consistency), set acceptable thresholds, decide how quality will be measured, and name the person responsible. Publish this. Make it visible.

**Week 7: Build-Buy-Partner Decisions.** Take the capability gaps you identified in Phase 1. Run each one through the decision matrix from Post 9. For each gap, decide: are we building, buying, or partnering? Document the rationale. This becomes your technology roadmap.

**Week 8: Select Partners and Initiate Procurement.** For every buy or partner decision from Week 7, start procurement. This is not the week to agonize over vendor comparisons. You did that analysis in Week 7. This is the week to sign LOIs, start pilots, and get contracts moving. Procurement cycles kill momentum. Start them early.

## Phase 3: Build (Days 61-90)

Design without execution is just planning. The final thirty days are about putting pieces in production.

**Week 9: Establish Core Pipelines.** Take your highest-priority AI use case and build (or harden) the data pipeline that feeds it. This pipeline should incorporate the quality standards from Week 6, the compliance constraints from Week 3, and the infrastructure decisions from Week 7. It should have monitoring. It should have alerting. It should be documented.

**Week 10: Train Your Team.** The tools and frameworks you selected in Phase 2 require your team to learn them. Dedicate a week to structured training. Not a webinar. Not a Confluence link. Dedicated, focused training with assessments. Your team cannot operate a new infrastructure if they have not been taught how.

**Week 11: Run Your First AI Pilot.** Deploy a model on production-quality data with proper governance, proper explainability, and proper monitoring. The model does not need to be sophisticated. It needs to be correct -- correct data, correct permissions, correct documentation, correct monitoring. This pilot is a proof of operating model, not a proof of AI capability.

**Week 12: Retrospective and Roadmap.** Gather your team. Review the ninety days. What worked? What stalled? Where did the plan survive contact with reality and where did it break? Measure the outcomes against the success indicators in the table above. Then build the next ninety-day plan based on what you learned.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Ninety days will not make you an AI company. I want to be direct about that because the market is full of people selling ninety-day AI transformations, and those people are lying to you.

What ninety days can do is build the foundation. It can give you a chartered team, clean data, smart partnerships, compliant infrastructure, and one working pilot that proves the operating model. That foundation is worth more than a hundred AI experiments run on bad data by a scattered team with no authority.

The organizations that are winning with AI did not start by buying GPUs or hiring prompt engineers. They started by doing the organizational work that makes AI possible. They built the department. They defined the standards. They claimed the authority. Then they built.

That sequence matters. It is the argument of this entire book. And this action plan is the sequence in practice.

## What to Do THIS Week

Before the ninety days even start, there are three things you should do this week to prepare the ground.

1. **Get your executive sponsor.** This plan requires organizational authority -- chartering a department, claiming data ownership, making build-buy decisions. You need a senior executive (ideally the CEO, realistically the COO or CFO) who will back these changes. Schedule a thirty-minute meeting this week. Bring the diagnosis framework. Explain what you intend to do in ninety days and what you need from them. Do not start the clock until you have this sponsorship.

2. **Name your team.** Identify the five to eight people who will execute this plan with you. They need to represent engineering, governance, analytics, and the business. They need dedicated time -- not "work this into your existing priorities" time, but protected hours each week. Write down their names. Tell them what is coming.

3. **Block the calendar.** Ninety days of organizational change does not happen in the margins. Block two hours every Monday morning for the next thirteen weeks. That is your action plan working session. Protect it the way you protect your board meeting prep. If it is not on the calendar, it will not happen.
